## Overview

The application aims to:
  - Provide a fair price for repair of malfunctions in a variety of fields: vehicles, cellular, electrical appliances and more.
  - Allow users to update a real-time price to a specific defect they have repaired, therefore creating a social network centered around monitoring prices and fixing malfunctions.

## The Rationale
Electrical day to day products tend to malfunction in an increasingly frequent rate. malfunctions in our cars and cellular phones have become routine, causing us waste large sums of money in order to try and repair them. How many times did your electric boiler disappoint you? How many times has your car break down just when you were in a rush? How many times have you broken the screen of your cell
phone? How many times did the compressor in your air conditioner had broken down? The repair of these defaults is done by professionals who often take advantage of the general public's innocence and ignorance,demanding large sums in order to fix something that is essential to our normal routine of life.
The public's lack of knowledge about "How much do we need to fix this problem?" Is the main reason for application development. This application will provide a solution to customers trying to estimate the cost of a malfunction in order to save money and promote the relationship between customers and honest professional technicians.

## Features
 - Show recent prices to correct the specific or similar problem.
 - Presentation of the closest technicians in the user's area.
 - A system of reward points for active users of the application.
 - An organized registration system.
 - Product replacement button - If the price of fixing the problem is close to
the price of product itself, we will offer a Google search of a new product.
